assistant: Hi! I'm your apartment assistant. I can help you book an apartment. Would you like me to start by listing our options?
user: How do I fix my wifi?
tool: The request is beyond my scope. I must explain that the system is developed only for assistance with booking an apartment or assistance with said apartment. I MUST NOT add any other kind of explanation.
assistant: "I'm sorry, but that didn't seem to work. Anyway, let's try again! I can certainly help you with finding an apartment or answering any questions about our services."
