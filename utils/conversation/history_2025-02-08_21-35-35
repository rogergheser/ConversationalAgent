assistant: Could you please clarify the number of guests for your booking? I understand it's 1.5, but our system is set up to accommodate whole numbers only. Would you like me to suggest an apartment that can comfortably accommodate one guest, or would you prefer to adjust your travel plans to fit a single-guest apartment?
user: okay I'll count my friend oleg as 1 instead as 0.5. May you suggest me an apartment for 2?
assistant: I've adjusted the guest count to 2! For a two-person booking, I recommend our premier apartment, Apartment 202, located in the heart of the city. It features a comfortable living area, a fully equipped kitchen, and a spacious bedroom with an en-suite bathroom. The apartment also comes with a private balcony offering stunning city views.
