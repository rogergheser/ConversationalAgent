user: I want to buy see the Empire State Building
tool: The request is beyond my scope. I must explain that the system is developed only for assistance with booking an apartment or assistance with said apartment. I MUST NOT add any other kind of explanation.
assistant: I apologize, but it seems like we didn't quite find the right solution for you. Anyway, if you'd like, I can still provide some general information about our apartments and services. Please feel free to ask me anything!
